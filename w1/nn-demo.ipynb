    "Assignment info: You can try to **implement a two-layer neural network using just basic Python and numpy** (so no torch, TensorFlow, Jax, etc.) from scratch. The network takes as **input a vector of size 64 and outputs a vector of size 2**. The first hidden unit has **32 neurons and a ReLU activation, while the output has a softmax activation**. The loss function is the categorical cross-entropy.What really matters here is that you try to code the backpropagation phase manually. That helps a lot in understanding how neural networks work!"
